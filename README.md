# Roslagen Escape – Hotel Booking Website
🚧 Work in progress

![Project preview](./screenshots/home.png)

Roslagen Escape is a fictional hotel booking website built as a full-stack practice project.  
The goal of the project was to simulate a real hotel website where users can explore rooms, view menus, and go through a booking flow.

The project focuses on building a **responsive frontend application with React**, while also practicing **backend development with Java and Spring Boot**.

The project uses **page-based routing** with reusable **component-based UI elements**.

# Booking Flow

The booking process follows a multi-step flow:

1. User searches for available dates and number of guests
2. Available rooms are displayed
3. The user selects a room and optional add-ons
4. The user fills in booking information
5. A booking confirmation page is generated

A booking reference number is automatically generated for each completed booking.

# Design Principles

This project was built with the following principles in mind:

- Component-based architecture
- Separation between pages and reusable components
- Responsive layout
- Clear routing structure
- Clean and readable code structure

---

# Future Improvements

Some planned or possible improvements include:

- Fully connecting the booking flow to the backend API
- Storing bookings in a database
- Implementing authentication
- Improving form validation and error handling
- Extracting shared utilities and constants
- Adding automated tests
